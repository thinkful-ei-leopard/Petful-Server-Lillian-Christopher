## Summary

The Petful Aoption Center is the first strictly First in First out adoption center! We give a chance for EVERY pet to find their forever home without judgement based on looks. 
When you go to the adoption page, you can see others that are in line before you and every 5 seconds the person at the front of the line will adopt randomly a cat or dog. When you put in your name you'll be entered in line and when you get to the front of the line you're able to choose to adopt a dog or a cat. You'll be able to see people adopting pets behind you after this.
